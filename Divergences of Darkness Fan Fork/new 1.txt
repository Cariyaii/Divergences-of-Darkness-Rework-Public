Divergences of Darkness Rework presents...

FOURTH RELEASE - THE GERMAN PHOENIX

Es liegt eine Krone im tiefen Rhein,
Gezaubert von Gold und von Edelstein;
Und wer sie erhebet von tiefem Grund,
Den kr√∂nt man zu Aachen in selbiger Stund.

GERMAN UPDATE
- The long awaited German Update. When this thing was first proposed Victoria III was nothing more then a joke that we tell people will never be announced.
- The Entire German Region has been completely overhauled.
- Sit by and watch as hundreds of thousands of Germans starve to death in the Hollowing.

BOHEMIA
- My Liege
- The Kingdom of Bohemia is the most important state in Germany
- Or at least Sigismund tells himself that.
- Can Sigismund unify the Holy Roman Empire?
- Or will Bohemia learn to create a more Equal German Confederation.

HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE
- Disclaimer: There will be bugs
- Conquer Europe. Unironically.
- Either by the Revolutionary Imperial German Republic or the Absolute Holy Roman Empire

ELBIAN CONFEDERATION
- If you don't want to win the game instantly
- Solve Bohemia's Political Chaos after the collapse of the Empire
- Go on to defeat Scandinavia and rule North Germany
- At least the Elbian Parts of Germany...

DANUBIAN STATES
- Create a New Germany
- Well more just a Danubian State since creating Germany is a bit harder then just unifing Danubia
- Either sit around until the 1900s or defeat Burgundy in a inevitable war over Swabia

SCANDINAVIA
- Painfully try to unify Northern Germany under your rule.
- Many will try to stop you.
- There will be more content in the next release.

BURGUNDY
- The red menace finally has completed content
- Either play as Jean's Absolutist Hellhole or Parlimentary Burgundy and abolish the Monarchy
- Destroy the Dual Monarchy, Tame the Germans and finally reach that Hyperpower status that Burgundy rightfully deserves.

THE GERMAN PHOENIX
- Germany will be unified
- If you like it or not.
- Eventually the German Eagle will rise.

ZHOURAO
- Three states now dot the Eastern Coast and each want to unify the continent
- Play as the Commander of the Faithful, the Corporate Paradise or the nascent worker democracy
- Be wary because the Europeans will likely try very hard to stop you.
- However after that, the Australian continent and Oceania at large is your playground


DISCLAIMER: This release has so much code work that its on a scale that makes even the Russian Rework look small. There will be a lot of bugs. The testers have done the best they can at minimizing the amount of bugs on release but there are likely a few untested things in a few particular rare or unique paths that may or may not work.
