Divergence of Darkness Rework

Disclaimers:

There are likely a lot of localization key bugs and missing localization throughout this mod. We will likely try to address a lot of the issues in the coming weeks.
HPM/HFM Rebels can be extremely brutal if you manage to get high WE and nothing I can do will fix that. Don’t get high WE.
If you want to pass reforms with Market Liberals or Radicalists then get high militancy without imploding.
India is basically unplayable after the Hindustan Conference.  India will need a rework in the future to make inland states much more playable (don’t expect much from the coast though).
China also needs a complete rework. Likely won’t get around to either China or India until a theoretical Victoria 3 release though.
Germany feels a bit railroaded currently and only has a few potential outcomes but that will be addressed in release two along with Italy and the North Balkans
Prior to release two (soon) there will be a much more viable way to stop Russia from happening added to the mod.
We will also fix the problem that occurs when Provence wins in Tuscany.
